The Development Plan records important decision for the team on the agreed upon
approach for the project.

\begin{itemize}
\item Follows writing checklist (full checklist provided in a separate document)
  \begin{todolist}
  \item \LaTeX{} points
  \item Structure
  \item Spelling, grammar, attention to detail
  \item Avoid low information content phrases
  \item Writing style
  \item Hyperlinks should be done properly (\texttt{\textbackslash ref})
  \end{todolist}

\item Document
  \begin{todolist}
  \item Follows outline in template repo (minor changes are okay, as long as
  rubric items are covered)
  \item Document makes decisions (not an empty exercise).  Decisions can be changed later.
  \item PoC demo plans are included (they can be changed later if necessary)
  \item Risk used to plan PoC is clearly expressed
  \item The Risks for the PoC plan are related to implementation risks, not to
  safety or security
  \item PoC plan is feasible for completing by November
  \item PoC plan is NOT described as a prototype (the PoC should be less
  ambitious and more focused than a prototype)
  \item Potential mitigation strategies are outlined for a ``failed'' PoC demo.
  Detailed plans are not needed, but thought should be given to what will the
  team do if the risk highlighted by the PoC demo appears to not be something
  the team can overcome.
  \item Mitigation strategies for a ``failed'' PoC are NOT provided.  We can
  discuss how to redefine the scope after the PoC demo.
  \item Team members have been given project-level roles (e.g. meeting chair, team liaison, etc.)
  \item Team members have technical roles (e.g. back-end, front-end, pytorch expert, etc.)
  \item A team member, or team members, possibly on a rotating basis, are
  assigned to quality assurance.  People in this role will check all
  deliverables, especially by checking the checklist and the Avenue rubric.
  \item Team roles are assigned with flexibility and overlap.  Too rigid a
  structure is potentially problematic.
  \item The chosen technology tools are explained and justified, possibly with
  pros and cons
  \end{todolist}

\item{Team Charter}
\begin{todolist}
  \item Trigger for a problem is quantified
  \item Consequence of problematic behaviour is expressed
  \item Exercise of planning team charter is done with sincerity
  \end{todolist}

\end{itemize}
