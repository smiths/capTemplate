An Advanced Research Report is a report that counts as two extras.  The research
report in most cases should be written following the structure of an academic
paper.  There should be components like a motivation, the research questions,
the methodology, the options considered, the evaluations criteria, the results,
etc. In most cases the project supervisor can help with this.
