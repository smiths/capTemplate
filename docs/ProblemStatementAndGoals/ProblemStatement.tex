\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{This project focuses on integrating Nonlinear Convolutional Response Functions(NCRFs) into the existing TRF pipeline to extend its capability for modeling nonlinear brain responses}. 

\subsection{Problem}
\wss{The project aims to integrate NCRFs into the pipeline, enabling more accurate analysis of EEG data.}


\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}
\wss{The input for the pipeline includes the original EEG data and speech features. \\The output data including the pre-processed data, statistical results and visualization results.}


\subsection{Stakeholders}
\wss{Stakeholders involve the lab members, researcher and students who will use the pipeline for their EEG analyses.}
\subsection{Environment}

\wss{The project will be developed based on Python, Conda, Eelbrain on MacOS/Windows/Linux. }

\section{Goals}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Enable the analysis of nonlinear EEG responses by integrating NCRF modeling into the existing TRF pipeline.
    \item Provide more complete neural response models by combining linear and nonlinear analyses.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Stretch Goals}
\wss{Provide an interactive GUI for the usage of this pipeline and enable more flexible analysis methods.}

\section{Extras}

\wss{Although this project is not a research project, it still requires a certain level of knowledge in neuroscience and related data processing methods; otherwise, users might be confused about the pipeline's functionality.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item User documentation: Provide detailed instructions, including installation, preprocessing steps, NCRF analysis, and visualization.
\item Pipeline demonstration: Include a working example with sample EEG and speech data to illustrate the pipeline's functions.
\end{enumerate}
